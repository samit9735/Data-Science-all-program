1. A sample of the various prices for a particular product has been conducted in 16 stores which were selected at random in a neighborhood of a city. The following prices were noted:
95, 108, 97, 112, 99, 106, 105, 100, 99, 98, 104, 110, 107, 111, 103, 110.
Assuming that the prices of this product follow a normal distribution with a variance of 25 and an unknown mean:
	a.What is the sample mean?

	b.Determine the confidence interval at 95% for the population mean.


2. Suppose that an accounting firm does a study to determine the time needed to complete one personâ€™s tax forms. It randomly surveys 100 people. The sample mean is 23.6 hours.   The population distribution is assumed to be normal a known standard deviation of 7.0 hours. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the population mean time to complete the tax forms.

3. The average heights of a random sample of 400 people from a city is 1.75 m. It is known that the heights of the population are random variables that follow a normal distribution with a variance of 0.16.

a. Determine the average heights of the population with an interval of 95% confidence. 
b. With a confidence level of 90%, what would the minimum sample size need to be in order for the true mean of the heights to be less than 2 cm from the sample mean?

4. Suppose you do a study of acupuncture to determine how effective it is in relieving pain. You measure sensory rates for 15 subjects with the results given. Use the sample data to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean sensory rate for the population (assumed normal) from which you took the data.
